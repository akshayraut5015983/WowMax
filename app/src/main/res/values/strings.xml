● Video needs to be in original aspect ratio.\n
● 1920 x 1080 square pixel aspect ratio material\n
● Native frame rate of original source.\n\n
\t\t\t\tIMPORTANT NOTES\n
• Anti-Smoking disclaimer, media credits, url or promotional tagging should be edited.\n
• Intermission slate should be edited.\n
• All videos must begin and end with one second black slug.\n\n
\t\t\t\tSD FORMAT IS ACCEPTABLE ONLY IF HD MASTER IS NOT MANUFACTURED.
Film Audio Source Profile
For every film that 5.1 Surround audio is available in any competing format or market,
it must be provided in addition to the stereo tracks.
Surround\n
● LPCM in either Big Endian or Little Endian, 16-bit or 24-bit, at least 48Khz.\n
● Expected channels: L, R, C, LFE, Ls, Rs.
Stereo\n
● LPCM in either Big Endian or Little Endian, 16-bit or 24-bit, at least 48Khz.
Subtitle\n
●A full translation of all the words spoken in the film including songs.\n
●Subtitle as a separate file (.dfxp or .xml)\n
●Subtitles must encompass all the spoken dialogue in the content. If the content has
multiple spoken languages, they all must be translated and present in the subtitle file.\n
●Subtitle files must not be censored or contain advertisements, placards, overlay
branding, website link callouts or company credits.\n\n
\t\t\t\tClosed Captions\n
Include as much of the original content as possible.\n
 Do not simplify or water down the original dialogue.\n
 Truncating the original dialogue should be limited to instances where reading speed
and
 synchronicity to the audio are an issue.\n
● Captions as a separate TTML (.dfxp or .xml) file
Forced Narrative
Our preference is to receive a non-subtitled version of the content.
To support the non-subtitled source, Netflix needs Forced Narrative subtitles delivered
as ancillary files.\n\n
Examples of text to be included in Forced Narrative subtitles:\n
Translation where an alternate language is spoken.\n
 Transcription of inaudible dialogue if it would have been included in broadcast or
theatrical presentation.\n
\t\t\t\tFor example: An English language film has 5 minutes of Japanese dialogue and is to be
streamed to U.S. customers. The desired video would not include burned in subtitles for
the Japanese sections. A Forced Narrative subtitle file would be supplied that contains
the Japanese dialogue translated into English. The Forced Narrative file would not have
the original English dialogue transcribed.\n
The technical format of Forced Narrative subtitles must follow the same rules as
standard subtitles i.e (.dfxp or .xml).\n\n
Artwork\n
All artwork assets should be 300 dpi. Detailed artwork delivery guideline is given
below
